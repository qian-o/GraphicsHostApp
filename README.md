# GraphicsHostApp
This is a simple application that hosts a graphics control. It is used to demonstrate how to use the `OpenGL ES` graphics APIs in a Avalonia application.

## Description
This example mainly explains how to use the OpenGL ES API in an Avalonia application, and how to perform OpenGL ES interop in a cross-language situation.
```
C# uses the Silk.NET library to call the OpenGL ES API.

C++ uses the Glad library to call the OpenGL ES API.
```
Also explained how to use shaders in OpenGL ES, how to encapsulate the API in an object-oriented way, and how to enable MSAA anti-aliasing and use FBO for off-screen rendering.
